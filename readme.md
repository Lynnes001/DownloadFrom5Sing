# A SpringBoot Toy

## Functionality

Provide an API (`/accompaniment?keyword=xxx`) that search from 5sing.com and download the first accompaniment. You will need a PostgreSQL database because it will run Flyway migration and save the accompaniment as binary file to it. 

Appreciate it if you tried. ‚ù§ :heart:



## Acknowledgement

I am standing on the giant shoulder :)
